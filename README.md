# Text-Summarizer-Project
Creating a Streamlit application to process and summarize system ticket data for a specific customer. The ticket data is provided in a text file, which will be converted to a CSV or Excel format. The application will preprocess the data, generate detailed summaries for various ticket categories, and present them in a storytelling format.
